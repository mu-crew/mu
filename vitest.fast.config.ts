/**
 * The pre-commit suite: everything that does NOT drive a real tmux server.
 *
 * Runs in PARALLEL, and that is the whole point of this file. The base config
 * pins `maxWorkers: 1` because the integration tests share one user tmux server
 * and contend on its socket -- a real constraint, but one that belongs to the
 * `*.integration.test.ts` files, not to the fast tier. Inheriting the cap here
 * made the fast suite serial for a reason none of its tests have.
 *
 * Measured when the fast suite was 1998 tests in 130 files:
 *
 *   maxWorkers: 1   255s   (import 135s -- ~1039ms per file, paid one at a time)
 *   maxWorkers: 8    44s   (import 181s, but overlapped)
 *
 * 5.8x, same 1998 passing. The cost was never the tests -- `tests` was 86s of
 * the 255 -- it was module loading serialised behind a one-worker cap. A slow
 * gate is a gate people skip, and this one is run before every commit.
 *
 * Derived from the machine rather than pinned: 8 was the measurement, not a
 * tuned optimum, and a hard-coded worker count is how a config stops matching
 * the box it runs on. Setting `maxWorkers` to `undefined` does NOT work --
 * mergeConfig keeps the inherited value, so the cap survived and the suite still
 * took 188s. The override has to be a real number. (vitest 4+ has no
 * `minWorkers`; only `maxWorkers` sizes the pool.)
