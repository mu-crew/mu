// mu — waitForTasks: block until tasks reach a target status.
//
// The orchestrator pattern: dispatch N workers via mu task claim --for,
// then wait until they're all done before reviewing/merging.
//
// Pre-existing alternatives + why this verb exists:
//
//   awk pipe over `mu log --tail`: works for ONE event but the
//     awk script becomes stateful (tracking 'which of N have closed?')
//     for multi-task waits. Bad shape for SKILL examples.
//
// Implementation:
//
//   1. Initial check — if the wait condition is already satisfied,
//      exit immediately. No subscription needed.
//   2. Otherwise, poll the tasks table every pollMs. Same cadence as
//      mu log --tail (default 1000ms). We don't subscribe to
//      agent_logs because (a) we'd still need to re-query tasks to
//      learn the current status, (b) some status changes happen via
//      mu sql which doesn't emit events, and (c) the polling cost is
//      one indexed SELECT every second — cheaper than parsing the
//      log stream.
//   3. Exit on success (all/any reached) OR timeout. Caller maps
//      timeout to exit code 5.
