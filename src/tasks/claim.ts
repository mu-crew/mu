// mu — claim/release/resolveActorIdentity verbs.
//
// claimTask is the heart of mu's coordination protocol: an atomic
// CAS via a single SQL UPDATE, with two flavours:
//
//   "worker claim"  : --for <name> sets owner=<name> (FK to agents.name)
//   "anonymous claim": --self      keeps owner=NULL but flips status to
//                                  IN_PROGRESS and records the actor
//                                  in agent_logs
//
// resolveActorIdentity is the env-aware identity helper:
// $MU_AGENT_NAME > pane title > $USER > 'orchestrator'. Used by --self
// AND by the bare worker-claim path, so both flavours answer "who am
// I?" identically.
