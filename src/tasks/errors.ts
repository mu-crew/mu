// mu — task error classes.
//
// Every task verb that can fail in a typed way has its own error class
// here. The CLI's `classifyError()` (src/cli.ts) maps them to exit codes:
//   not found  → 3   (TaskNotFoundError)
//   conflict   → 4   (TaskExistsError, TaskNotInWorkstreamError,
//                     TaskAlreadyOwnedError, TaskHasOpenDependentsError,
//                     ClaimerNotRegisteredError, CrossWorkstreamEdgeError,
//                     TaskIdInvalidError)
//   cycle      → 4   (CycleError — also a conflict)
//
// Each error implements HasNextSteps so the CLI can render a per-error
// `Next:` block with the most useful follow-up commands.
//
// Extracted from src/tasks.ts as part of refactor_split_large_src_files.
