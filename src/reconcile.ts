//   1. Prune ghost rows whose pane no longer exists in the mux.

//   3. Surface orphan panes that look like agents but have no DB row.

 *                 to OPEN with [reaper] notes), refreshes pane titles

 *
 *   "report-only" Pure observation. Counts would-be-pruned ghosts
 *                 without deleting; skips the title refresh (no DB
 *                 writes, no tmux title writes); surfaces orphans
 *                 (pure read). Used by `mu doctor` (read-only
 *                 diagnostic).
 *
 * Mid-spawn placeholders are protected directly in the prune loop, so read
 * paths no longer need a separate mode just to avoid racing spawn's workspace
