// mu — disk↔DB reconciliation for `mu doctor`.
//
// Every other check in doctor reads the DB. These read the STATE DIR, and
// then compare the two, because the two can disagree in both directions
// and nothing surfaced either one:
//
//   disk has, DB doesn't  ->  workspace orphan / empty parent / residue
//   DB has, disk doesn't  ->  a `vcs_workspaces` row pointing at nothing
//
// The second direction had NO surface at all before this module.
// `mu workspace list` prints such a row as if it were fine, and every
// spawn that reuses it fails deep in the VCS backend with a path error
// rather than at the row that lied.
//
// REPORT ONLY, on purpose. Each finding names its own cleanup command in
// the remediation block and mu runs none of them: an operator or an agent
// reading doctor's output decides. A diagnostic verb that deletes 300MB
// of checkouts because a readdir raced a spawn is a worse bug than the
// residue it removes.
//
// TIERED like the drift check. The default tier is readdir + stat, depth
// 2 (measured ~1ms on a 5-workstream / 5196-file state dir). Recursive
// byte accounting is `--disk` only: its cost scales with the checkout,
// not with mu's own state, so it must not ride a reflexively-run command.
