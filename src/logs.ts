// mu — the log surface, as a thin shim over the **ops log**.
//
// @deprecated — v2-log-verb replaces this module. v9 dropped the
// `agent_logs` table; `ops` is now the single append-only record of
// every change (VISION.md § 2b). Rather than rewrite ~25 consumers in
// the schema commit, this module keeps its legacy signatures
// (appendLog / listLogs / latestSeq / emitEvent) and reads and writes
// `ops` rows underneath. v2-capture makes triggers the real writers
// and v2-log-verb re-renders `mu log` from intents; both delete
// chunks of this file.
//
// Shim mapping (legacy log row -> op):
//   kind       -> ops.entity     ('message' | 'event' | ...)
//   source     -> ops.actor
//   workstream -> ops.key        (natural key; '' = machine-wide)
//   payload    -> ops.payload    (raw text, not JSON, until v2-capture)
//   seq        -> ops.seq        (same AUTOINCREMENT cursor semantics)
//
// `ops.hlc` is now a REAL HLC minted by `nextHlc` (src/hlc.ts). The old
// placeholder `<iso>|<uuid>` is gone: `parseHlc` deliberately rejects
// that shape as a tripwire, so leaving it would have failed loudly the
// moment anything downstream read the log in HLC order.
//
// `group_id` is still a fresh uuid per entry rather than the ambient
// **op context** group. That is correct for this module's remaining
// callers, which are log APPENDS (`mu log write`, event breadcrumbs) —
// each is its own user-visible action, not part of a row-mutation
// group. Rows written through the capture triggers get the ambient
// group; these are hand-written log lines, not captured mutations.

// the prose entities was needed so a single `task add` did not surface
// twice.
//
// The duplicate prose emits are gone, so the filter's reason to exist
// went with them. `mu log` now reads EVERY op, which is what
// docs/VOCABULARY.md § log entry has always claimed ("a rendered op...
// not a distinct table"). Payloads for captured ops are still raw JSON;
// v2-log-verb renders prose from `intent`. Uglier for now, honest, and
// no longer lossy: a peer's synced ops appear in `mu log` too, which
// prose events could never do (they were machine-local by accident of
// entity='event' not being in SYNCED_ENTITIES).
//

// two disagreed, `mu log --tail` started its cursor past rows the
// non-tail view had shown and silently skipped them.
