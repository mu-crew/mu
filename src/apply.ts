// mu — the APPLY path: how one op lands in the portable tables.
//
// The counterpart to src/capture.ts. Capture answers "a row changed,
// what op records it"; this answers "here is an op, local or from a
// peer, what does the table look like afterwards". v2-sync will call
// `applyOp` once per op it ingests; this module knows nothing about
// segments, files or watermarks.
//
// THE MERGE RULES (docs/VOCABULARY.md; v2-merge-rules)
// ---------------------------------------------------
//   note / message      GROW-ONLY SET. Insert-if-absent by origin
//                       identity. Never updated, so never in conflict.
//   task / workstream   PER-FIELD LWW by HLC. Not row-level.
//   edge                LWW-ELEMENT-SET: add/remove, each carrying an
//                       HLC, so a remove and a re-add order correctly.
//   anything else       NOT SYNCED. Rejected loudly.
//
// WHY PER-FIELD AND NOT ROW-LEVEL
// -------------------------------
// The original design note argued row-level LWW sufficed, because "the
// operating rule is already no concurrent edits to one workstream on two
// machines". That assumption is weak in mu specifically: mu runs
// autonomous agent crews, so a crew on the devserver closing a task
// while the operator edits that same task's impact on a laptop is
// concurrent multi-machine writing BY CONSTRUCTION, not user error.
// Row-level LWW would let the crew's status=CLOSED clobber the
// operator's impact=80, silently, with no conflict reported.
//
// Per-field costs nothing extra here because capture already emits
// SEMANTIC PARTIAL UPDATES: a task.close op carries {"status":"CLOSED"},
// not a row snapshot. So "apply each op's keys in HLC order" IS
// per-field LWW. No column version vectors, no per-column metadata, none
// of the cr-sqlite machinery we rejected.
//
// PROVENANCE: DERIVED FROM THE OPS LOG, NOT STORED
// ------------------------------------------------
// Per-field LWW needs to know, per field, the HLC that last wrote it.
// The obvious shape is a side table keyed (entity, key, field) -> hlc.
// This module does NOT do that, and the reason is worth stating because
// the brief explicitly asked for a justification.
//
// The ops log ALREADY IS the per-field provenance. Every op carries its
// HLC and names exactly the fields it touched, and `idx_ops_entity_key`
// indexes (entity, key). So "the HLC that last wrote field F of key K"
// is a query over the ~handful of ops for K, not a fact needing separate
// storage. Deriving it instead of storing it means:
//
//   * ONE source of truth. A side table is a denormalisation that can
//     disagree with the log, and when it does, every downstream
//     projection (undo, sync) inherits the disagreement. There
//     is no reconciliation procedure that could fix it, because nothing
//     would know which side was right.
//   * Idempotence for free. Re-applying an op compares HLCs against the
//     log, which already contains that op, so a second apply is a no-op
//     by construction rather than by careful bookkeeping. That is what
//     makes "re-read a peer's segment from zero" a safe universal
//     repair.
//   * Resurrection survives deletion for free. See below.
//   * Storage cost: ZERO additional bytes. A side table would cost one
//     row per (key, field) — for the 8 captured columns of `tasks`, 8
//     rows per task, each ~60 bytes of key text plus a ~55-byte HLC, so
//     roughly 1KB per task, unbounded in the number of tasks and
//     duplicating data already on disk in `ops`.
//
// Measured cost of deriving: ~10us per key against a 16000-op / 2000-task
// log (index seek over that key's ~8 ops). Ingest is already doing a
// write per op, so this is not the bottleneck, and it buys the absence of
// a whole class of drift bug. If a profile ever says otherwise, the fix
// is a materialised cache keyed off `ops.seq` that can be rebuilt from
// the log — which is exactly the kind of thing to add when measured, not
// before.
//
// RESURRECTION vs A STALE PUT
// ---------------------------
// After a `del`, a LATER `put` must recreate the row (a legitimate
// re-add), while an EARLIER `put` arriving late must not. Distinguishing
// them requires provenance that outlives the row — and derived
// provenance does, automatically, because `ops` rows are never deleted
// when a table row is. A stored side table would have to be deliberately
// NOT cleaned up on delete, which is a rule someone eventually
// "optimises" away.
//
// TOMBSTONES ARE JUST OPS (v2-tombstones)
// ---------------------------------------
// There is no tombstone table. `op='del'` rows ARE the tombstones,
// ordinary ops carrying an HLC, so out-of-order arrival is just "compare
// HLCs" — the same comparison the update path does. A late `put` older
// than a seen `del` loses; a `del` older than a seen `put` loses. One
// code path, no special casing.

/**
 * Re-project note and edge ops that could not land when they arrived.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX (v2-sync-workflow-integration)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * `applyNotePut` / `applyEdgePut` return `skipped:"absent"` when the
 * task they hang off is not here YET. That is the right answer at that
 * moment — there is genuinely nowhere to put the row — and their
 * comments promised "re-reading the peer's segment replays the task op
 * first and this lands then". It does not. `ingestSegment` counts an
 * `absent` skip as a successful apply and ADVANCES THE WATERMARK past
 * the line, so the segment is never re-read and the note or edge is
 * never projected. The op IS recorded in local `ops`, so the data is
 * not lost — but the live tables silently diverge, permanently.
 *
 * It is not a corner case. `flushSegment` ships only LOCAL ops, so a
 * machine's segment routinely holds `edge`/`note` ops referring to
 * tasks created in ANOTHER machine's segment, and `syncPass` reads
 * peers in `discoverPeers` order — `localeCompare` over random UUID
 * filenames. Whether the parent arrives first is a coin flip. Measured
 * on 8 fresh fleets: 5 dropped the edge, 3 kept it, correlating exactly
 * with segment filename sort order.
 *
 * WHY REPAIR FROM THE LOG RATHER THAN A RETRY QUEUE
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * A queue of "ops to try again" would be a second source of truth that
 * can disagree with `ops` — the same denormalisation this module's
 * header rejects for provenance, and it would be lost across processes
 * (mu is one short-lived process per invocation, so an in-memory list
 * only ever fixes ops deferred within a SINGLE pass; the parent often
 * arrives the next day). The ops log already knows everything needed,
 * so this asks it directly: which note/edge puts are resolvable NOW but
 * are not projected?
 *
 * "Resolvable now" is doing real work in both queries. Restricting to
 * ops whose parent task rows EXIST means an op orphaned for good (its
 * task was deleted) is not retried on every pass forever, and excluding
 * keys with a NEWER `del` means a legitimately removed edge or note is
 * not resurrected. What is left is exactly the bug's footprint, which
 * in a healthy DB is the empty set — so the normal cost is two indexed
 * queries returning zero rows.
 *
 * Returns the number of ops that changed something, so callers can
 * report it and tests can assert the repair actually fired.
