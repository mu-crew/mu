// mu — op capture: SQLite triggers that record every change to a
// portable table as an op, inside the SAME TRANSACTION as the mutation.
//
// WHY TRIGGERS AND NOT HAND-EMITTED OPS
// -------------------------------------
// Capture fires inside the same transaction as the row change, in the
// same file. So capture is ATOMIC with the change: the two cannot
// drift, not even on power loss mid-write. Either both landed or
// neither did.
//
// Hand-emitted ops (an `emitOp(...)` next to each mutation) were
// rejected because they can be FORGOTTEN. A forgotten op is no
// longer "sync missed something" — undo, sync and history are
// ALL projections of this one log, so one missing op is silent
// corruption of all four at once. A future SDK function that mutates
// `tasks` must not be ABLE to skip capture. Triggers make that
// structural rather than a convention someone has to remember.
//
// WHY THE TRIGGERS ARE TEMP TRIGGERS (the load-bearing surprise)
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// The triggers need per-invocation context (intent / actor / group /
// the echo guard) which lives in the `_op_ctx` TEMP table. SQLite
// REFUSES to let a main-schema trigger reference the temp schema:
//
//   sqlite> CREATE TRIGGER x AFTER INSERT ON tasks
//        >   WHEN (SELECT applying FROM _op_ctx) = 0 ...
//   Error: no such table: main._op_ctx
//   -- and qualifying it explicitly fails differently:
//   Error: trigger x cannot reference objects in database temp
//
// So the triggers themselves must live in the TEMP schema, where the
// temp table IS visible. Verified empirically (see the probe results in
// this task's note). Consequences, all of them fine:
//
//   * Triggers are (re)created per connection, by `installCapture`,
//     which `openDb` calls on every open. There is no persistent
//     trigger in the DB file, so no stale-DDL-in-file problem and no
//     schema-version churn when the trigger set changes.
//   * A connection that never runs `installCapture` captures nothing.
//     That is only reachable inside this codebase (readonly opens), not
//     by a normal `mu` invocation.
//   * A TEMP trigger cannot write to a qualified `main.ops` —
//     "qualified table names are not allowed on INSERT, UPDATE, and
//     DELETE statements within triggers" — so the INSERTs here are
//     UNQUALIFIED and resolve to `main` because no temp table shadows
//     those names. `_op_ctx` / `_op_clock` / `_op_dying` are prefixed
//     to make that shadowing impossible by accident.
//
// SEMANTIC PARTIAL UPDATES — ONLY CHANGED COLUMNS
// -----------------------------------------------
// The UPDATE triggers compare `NEW.<col> IS NOT OLD.<col>` per column
// and build the payload from just the columns that actually changed, so
// `task.close` carries `{"status":"CLOSED"}` and nothing else. This is
// the single detail that makes per-field merge FREE: "apply in HLC
// order" then converges without column version vectors.
//
// Dumping the whole row instead would look identical in every
// single-machine test and silently regress the design from field-level
// to row-level last-writer-wins. mu runs autonomous agent crews, so a
// devserver crew closing a task while the operator edits that task's
// impact on a laptop is concurrent multi-machine writing BY
// CONSTRUCTION. Field-level merge keeps both edits; row-level LWW
// discards one at random. `IS NOT` (not `<>`) because `<>` is NULL for
// a NULL operand, which would drop every set-to-NULL and
// NULL-to-a-value transition — e.g. releasing a claim
// (`owner_id -> NULL`) would never be captured.

// TYPE-ONLY import: db.ts imports this module, so a value import would
// be a runtime cycle (and an import cycle here shows up as `node
// dist/cli.js` printing nothing at all). `typeof PORTABLE_TABLES` is a
// type position, so this is erased at compile time.
import type { PORTABLE_TABLES } from "./db.js";

 *  resolved. Should be unreachable — the dying-ancestor stash below

 * DDL for the three per-connection temp tables the triggers read.

 *
 *   _op_ctx    the **op context** (docs/VOCABULARY.md): group_id /
 *              actor / intent / applying. Exactly ONE row, seeded with
 *              defaults so a mutation occurring outside any SDK context
 *              is still CAPTURED, just with a null intent. Fail safe,
 *              never fail silent.
 *
 *   _op_clock  a one-row scratchpad holding "now" for the current
 *              trigger firing. The HLC advance needs to compare `now`
 *              against `last_wall` and then reuse the SAME `now` to
 *              write it; calling unixepoch() twice could straddle a
 *              millisecond boundary and mint a non-monotonic pair. So
 *              the value is stashed once per op and read from here.
 *
 *   _op_dying  natural keys of rows that are mid-DELETE — see the
 *              DELETE section below. Keyed by (kind, id).
 *
 * Temp tables are per-connection and mu is one connection per
 * short-lived process, so there is no cross-process leakage and no

/**
 * THE DELETE SUBTLETY
 * -------------------
 * Every other op can resolve its natural key lazily, because the row is
 * still there. DELETE cannot: by the time anything downstream looks,
 * the row is gone. So the key is captured INLINE, in the trigger, while
 * the row still exists.
 *
 * That alone is not enough, because of FK CASCADE. Empirically (this
 * was the thing most worth checking): SQLite FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`
 * DOES fire triggers on the cascaded child rows — and it does so
 * regardless of the `recursive_triggers` pragma, which governs only
 * trigger-initiated recursion, not FK actions. Good: destroying a
 * workstream captures its tasks, notes and edges without any explicit
 * walk in the SDK.
 *
 * The trap is ORDERING. With AFTER DELETE triggers, cascaded children
 * fire after the parent row is already deleted, so joining to the
 * parent to build the child's key yields nothing:
 *
 *   DELETE FROM workstreams WHERE id = 1
 *     -> edge  op key "<unresolved>-><unresolved>"
 *     -> note  op key "<unresolved>#100"
 *     -> task  op key "<unresolved>/t1"
 *
 * Two mechanisms fix it together:
 *
 *   1. BEFORE DELETE, not AFTER. The row and its ancestors are all
 *      still present when the trigger body runs, so `OLD.*` plus a
 *      normal join resolves the key.
 *   2. The `_op_dying` stash. BEFORE DELETE fixes the FIRST level only:
 *      cascade children still fire after their parent's row is gone.
 *      So each parent's BEFORE DELETE trigger records its own natural
 *      key into `_op_dying` before emitting, and the child key
 *      resolvers (`wsKey` / `taskKey`) consult the stash when the live
 *      join misses. Rows are never removed from the stash: it is a
 *      per-connection temp table on a short-lived process, ids are not
 *      reused within a transaction, and an INSERT OR REPLACE keyed on
 *      (kind, id) keeps it correct even if an id is recycled later.
 *
 * The alternative — having the parent trigger emit ops for its whole
 * subtree and suppressing the cascade triggers — also works and was
 * prototyped, but it duplicates the subtree walk in SQL four times and
 * breaks the moment a new FK is added. The stash is smaller and
 * self-maintaining.
