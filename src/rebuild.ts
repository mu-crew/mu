// mu — rebuild: materialize a fresh DB by replaying the ops log.
//
// The third leg of the ops-log substrate, after capture (write side) and
// apply (read side). This is the DISASTER-RECOVERY story that replaces
// the snapshot files mu no longer keeps: given an intact `ops` table, every
// portable row is reconstructable, because the log is the canonical
// record and the tables are a projection of it.
//
// It is also the foundation the doctor drift check stands on. "Is the
// projection still faithful to the log?" is answered by rebuilding into
// a temp DB and diffing — which is why `rebuildInto` takes the target
// path as a PARAMETER and prints nothing. All human output lives in the
// CLI layer (src/cli/rebuild.ts).
//
// REBUILD INTO A NEW FILE, NEVER IN PLACE
// ---------------------------------------
// Locked decision. A rebuild that overwrote the live DB would be a
// destructive operation whose failure mode is "no database at all", and
// it would have to hold a write lock over the whole replay. Writing a
// new file and PRINTING THE SWAP COMMAND keeps the operator in control:
// they can diff, inspect, and swap when ready. It also means a rebuild
// is safe to run at any time, including from the drift check, with no
// risk to live state.
//
// REBUILD IS NOT INGEST
// ---------------------
// The distinction is load-bearing and easy to get backwards.
//
//   ingest  = "absorb a PEER's ops". Only SYNCED_ENTITIES may cross a
//             machine boundary, so ingest filters. A peer's agent rows
//             are meaningless here (`pane_id` '%17' names a pane on
//             their box), so they must never arrive.
//   rebuild = "reconstruct MY OWN database". A local recovery
//             operation, so it must replay EVERYTHING the log knows,
//             including machine-local ops. Dropping them would silently
//             discard this machine's own log history — `mu log` would
//             come back empty after a recovery.
//
// So this module deliberately does NOT filter by SYNCED_ENTITIES. It
// copies every op verbatim and projects the ones that have a portable
// table to project into.
//
// WHAT A REBUILT DB LEGITIMATELY LOSES
// ------------------------------------
// The ops log only contains what capture recorded, and capture has
// triggers on the PORTABLE tables only. `agents` and `vcs_workspaces`
// have no triggers, so they leave no ops and cannot be reconstructed.
//
// That is CORRECT, not a gap. Both tables hold values that are
// meaningless after recovery: `agents.pane_id` names a tmux pane in a
// server that no longer has it, and `vcs_workspaces.path` is an absolute
// path whose working copy may be gone. Resurrecting either would produce
// rows that lie about reality, and `mu doctor` would immediately flag
// them as ghosts.
//
// But it must be REPORTED, never silent. An operator who rebuilds and
// does not realise their agent registry is empty will wonder why
// `mu agent list` is blank. `RebuildReport.machineLocalLost` carries the
// per-table counts so the CLI can say so explicitly and tell them to
// re-spawn.
