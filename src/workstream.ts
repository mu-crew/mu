// One workstream = one mux session + N agents + M tasks (and their

// (create the mux session) and `mu workstream teardown` (this module: nuke the
// mux session and every DB row tagged with the workstream name).
//
// `teardownWorkstream` is idempotent on every leg:
//   - mux session already gone         → killSession swallows the error
//   - no agents/tasks for this name    → DELETE returns zero changes

//
// Both summarize and teardown take an optional `muxSession` override so
// tests (and the rare workstream whose mux session was created with a
// non-default name) work without env-var gymnastics.
