// mu — drift detection: is the projection still faithful to the ops log?
//
// WHY THIS IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DIAGNOSTICS GARNISH
// ------------------------------------------------
// mu collapsed four independent change-recording mechanisms into ONE
// ops log. The upside is coherence. The cost, stated plainly in
// docs/VISION.md § 2b, is that a capture bug is no longer "sync is
// broken" — it is undo AND sync AND history broken,
// simultaneously and silently, because all four are projections of the
// same table.
//
// This module is what converts that from a hazard into a DETECTABLE
// CONDITION. It is the reason the consolidation was defensible at all,
// so it is production code: it must name what diverged precisely enough
// to act on at 3am, and it must not cry wolf on shapes that are
// legitimately asymmetric.
//
// HOW IT WORKS
// ------------
// Rebuild the log into a throwaway DB (src/rebuild.ts, whose target path
// is a parameter precisely so this can point it at a temp file), then
// diff the rebuilt tables against the live ones. The log is canonical by
// definition, so any divergence means either capture missed a mutation
// or apply is lossy. Both are bugs; neither is recoverable by guessing.
//
// TWO TIERS, AND WHY
// ------------------
// Measured on this machine (better-sqlite3 3.49, NVMe):
//
//     tasks    ops    rebuild
//       100    353      258ms
//       500   1742     1146ms
//      1000   3461     2178ms
//
// Linear in ops, ~0.6ms per op. `mu doctor` is expected to be fast and
// is run reflexively, so a 2s+ hit on a realistic DB is not acceptable
// as a default. Hence:
//
//   DEFAULT (`mu doctor`)  — `checkCheapDriftInvariant`, ~1ms: every
//                            live row must have at least one op naming
//                            its key. Catches an uncaptured INSERT or a
//                            row that exists with no history at all,
//                            which is the most common shape of a
//                            capture bug (a new mutation path that
//                            bypassed the triggers).
//   DEEP (`mu doctor --deep`) — full rebuild + field-level diff. Catches
//                            everything, including an uncaptured UPDATE,
//                            which the cheap check is structurally blind
//                            to because the key still has ops.
//
// That blindness is real and measured, not assumed: an uncaptured UPDATE
// leaves the cheap invariant reporting zero orphans. So the cheap check
// is a smoke alarm, not a proof, and the default run says so by pointing
// at --deep.
