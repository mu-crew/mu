// mu — shared multiplexer backend contracts and typed errors.
//
// A "mux" is the terminal multiplexer that owns panes. mu supports one
// active backend per invocation, chosen by `detectMux()` in ./detect.js.
// Everything backend-specific lives behind `MuxBackend`:
//
//   - session / window / pane topology
//   - the send protocol (bracketed paste on tmux)
//   - scrollback capture
//   - PANE ID VALIDATION — tmux `%15` vs herdr `w1:p1`, which is why
//     there is no global pane-id regex
//   - ACTOR IDENTITY fallback — how to ask "which agent is this pane?"
//
// Same shape as src/vcs/: a types module, one file per impl, and an
// index that dispatches. See docs/VOCABULARY.md § "mux backend".
