// before it costs them data.

//   (a) DB inside the sync dir  -> corruption. THE footgun of the design.
//   (b) DB on a network mount   -> broken WAL locking.
//   (c) case-colliding names    -> collide on macOS, coexist on Linux.

// The checks that need MU_SYNC_DIR read it if set and no-op otherwise,

 * another machine, produces a DB that opens fine and is silently corrupt.
 * Two machines writing the same synced file is worse still: last-writer
 * wins on the FILE, so an entire machine's history vanishes.
 *
 * mu's sync design specifically avoids this by shipping append-only
 * per-machine SEGMENTS (one writer per file, never contended) rather than
 * the DB itself. Putting the DB inside the sync dir defeats that on
 * purpose-built-to-be-safe transport, so it is a hard failure.
