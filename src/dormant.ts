// mu — dormant-workstream detection for `mu doctor`.
//
// The question this answers: "which workstreams can I tear down?" The
// operator had to answer it by eye, from `mu workstream list`, which
// prints row counts and no dates — so the two workstreams that had been
// untouched for three months looked exactly like the one worked on an
// hour ago. Teardown is reversible (tombstone ops + `mu undo`), so the
// cost of the missing surface was not risk, it was that nobody ever
// tore anything down and the list grew forever.
//
// TWO BUCKETS, NEVER ONE NUMBER
// -----------------------------
// "Stale-ish and/or no open tasks" is two different findings and
// merging them gives actively bad advice:
//
//   FINISHED  every task CLOSED, and idle a while. Nothing is at
//             stake. Safe to tear down, and that is what the
//             remediation says.
//   ABANDONED idle for a long time WITH unclosed tasks. Tearing this
//             down discards open work. The remediation is to LOOK
//             first, and the count of what would be lost is the whole
//             point of the row.
//
// On the box this was written against the split is the entire value:
// `mu` / `dash-search` / `dash-shortcuts` / `goto-murmur-dash` are
// finished (0 unclosed), while `infer-rs` (95 days, 19 unclosed) and
// `modelbridge` (89 days, 8 unclosed) are abandoned. One combined
// "dormant" list would have invited `--empty`-style sweeping of 27 open
// tasks.
//
// WHY NOT `teardown --empty`
// --------------------------
// That verb already exists and is deliberately narrower: ZERO tasks,
// agents and workspaces — test litter. Every workstream here has real
// history, so `--empty` never matches one. This check reports; it never
// sweeps. Same posture as src/disk-recon.ts: each finding names its own
// command and mu runs none of them.
//
// IDLE IS DERIVED, NOT STORED
// ---------------------------
// There is no `workstreams.last_activity` column and this does not add
// one. Activity is `MAX(tasks.updated_at)`, falling back to the
// workstream's own `created_at` when it has no tasks at all — a column
// would be a second source of truth that can disagree with the rows it
// summarises, which is the `provenance` reasoning in
// docs/VOCABULARY.md applied to a cheaper case.
