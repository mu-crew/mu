// mu — the sync seam: peer status, the ambient hook, and the two power
// tools behind `mu sync`.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE AND WHAT DOES NOT
// ---------------------------------
// `src/segments.ts` owns the MECHANISM (flush / ingest / watermarks /
// the four robustness layers). This file owns the OPERATOR-FACING
// questions that mechanism cannot answer on its own:
//
//   - who are my peers, how far behind am I, when did I last hear from
//     them (`peerStatuses`)
//   - the AMBIENT hook every mu invocation runs (`ambientIngest` /
//     `ambientFlush`)
//   - a DIFFERENT READER: a peer's `ops` table read straight out of a
//     copied / sshfs-mounted `mu.db` (`ingestFromDb`)
//   - the universal repair: reset a watermark and re-read from zero
//     (`repairPeer`)
//
// AMBIENT, NOT A DAEMON
// ---------------------
// There is no watcher, no background process, and no polling loop that
// outlives the command. Sync happens because you already run `mu`
// constantly: every invocation ingests before the verb body and flushes
// after it. With `MU_SYNC_DIR` unset both halves are a single `if` that
// reads one env var, so the single-machine case pays nothing. With 2-5
// peers it is a handful of `stat`/`read` calls on small append-only
// files.
//
// The TUI is the one long-lived surface, and it hangs the same pass off
// its SLOW tick (10s), never the 1s fast tick — sync is filesystem work
// and has no business on a repaint cadence.
//
// SYNC MUST NEVER FAIL A COMMAND
// ------------------------------
// A truncated segment, an unreadable sync dir, a full disk: all of them
// warn and return. `mu task add` has to work when sync is broken,
// because the alternative is a tool that stops working when a folder you
// do not control misbehaves. Every ambient entry point here is
// try/catch-total by construction (see `ambientIngest`).
//
// TRANSPORT STAYS THE OPERATOR'S
// ------------------------------
// mu reads and writes FILES. It does not shell out to ssh/scp/rsync, and
// it will not grow `--push <host>`: that is a remote backend wearing a
// small hat (ssh config, jump hosts, ProxyCommand, ports, identity
// files, interactive prompts inside a TUI tick, network-vs-auth error
// mapping), and it violates the standing ROADMAP pledge that the user
// owns transport. Instead, when a peer looks stale we PRINT a
// copy-pasteable rsync line through the ordinary NextStep convention and
// let the operator paste it, alias it, or run Syncthing and never see
// it.
