// The one glyph vocabulary. Every symbol mu paints as *state* is
// defined here and nowhere else.
//
// WHY ONE FILE
// Glyphs were previously inlined at each render site: "✓" in the
// Recent card, "✓" again in the Workspaces card, "✓" a third time in
// the doctor card, "⛓" in Blocked, "⚠" in two CLI formatters. Three
// spellings of "ok" drifted apart once already (the busy gear vs
// murmur's play glyph), and each inline literal is a place the next
// drift can start. One meaning, one constant.
//
// WHY ONE FAMILY
// All state glyphs are classic Nerd Font `nf-fa-*` (Font Awesome 4)
// codepoints. Two properties matter:
//
//   1. SINGLE CODEPOINT, SINGLE CELL. Unicode emoji like ⚙️ are two
//      codepoints (base + variation selector) that terminals draw one
//      cell wide. cli-table3 sizes columns by string length, so a
//      table mixing 1- and 2-codepoint glyphs misaligns. nf-fa slots
//      are private-use, all length-1, all one cell.
//   2. STABLE SLOTS. Avoid `nf-md-*`: those PUA codepoints move
//      between Nerd Font releases and silently render as the wrong
//      icon (mu's `idle` once looked like a red shield under md-sleep).
//
// This matches murmur's dash (`src/dash-paint.ts` in ../murmur), which
// drives the same tmux panes from the other side. `busy` here and
// `running` there are both nf-fa-play on purpose: one symbol, one
// meaning, across both surfaces.
//
// Requires a Nerd Font on the operator's terminal. mu's substrate is
// pi, which assumes one. Without it every glyph renders as a
// placeholder box — and the columns still line up, which is the bug
// the family rule exists to prevent.
//
// NOT IN HERE
// Typographic punctuation that carries no state: the `•` list bullet,
// the `—` empty-cell dash, `…` truncation, box-drawing borders. Those
// are text, not vocabulary, and stay at their call sites.
