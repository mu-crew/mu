// mu — DB module.
//
// Opens <state-dir>/mu.db (or the MU_DB_PATH override; see defaultDbPath),
// enables WAL + foreign keys, applies the schema idempotently, and
// exposes the live Database handle.
//
// Schema (v11 — task substates on the v10 three-state lifecycle):
//   - 6 entity tables: workstreams, agents, tasks, task_edges,
//                      task_notes, vcs_workspaces
//   - 1 ops log:       ops        (the single append-only record of
//                                  every change — VISION.md § 2b)
//   - 1 sync table:    sync_peers (per-peer watermarks)
//   - 2 meta tables:   schema_version, machine_identity
//   - 1 lookup table:  task_substates (legal (status, substate) pairs,
//                                      seeded from code when missing)
//   - 3 views:         ready, blocked, goals
//   => EXPECTED_TABLES is exactly 11 entries.
//
// v11 adds tasks.substate, which qualifies status (OPEN/parked,
// CLOSED/wontfix, ...). A composite FK (status, substate) ->
// task_substates, DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, is the only guard on
// the pair: it is checked at COMMIT, so apply's one-field-at-a-time
// UPDATEs pass as long as the pair is valid when the transaction ends.
//
// v9 is a BREAKING, migration-free redesign. It DROPS v8's four
// separate change-recording mechanisms — `agent_logs`, `snapshots`,
// `workstream_sync`, and the five `archived_*` tables — and replaces
// all of them with one **ops log**. Sync, undo, and history
// are queries or replays over that log (docs/VOCABULARY.md § op,
// ops log, watermark).
//
// The surrogate-INTEGER-PK discipline introduced in v5 is unchanged:
// per docs/architecture/sdk.md § Surrogate-PK and SDK-boundary discipline,
// every entity table has an INTEGER PK; FKs reference INTEGER ids;
// the operator-facing TEXT name is per-scope unique via
// UNIQUE (<scope_id>, <name>). `ops` is the deliberate exception: it
// holds the NATURAL key (`ws/local_id`) in `ops.key`, never a
// surrogate id, which is exactly why keys don't collide across
// machines.
//
// IMPORTANT: MIN_ACCEPTED_SCHEMA_VERSION === CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION
// === 11. There is no in-place forward-bump ladder: every pre-v11 DB
// is rejected at openDb time with SchemaTooOldError (exit 4), and a DB
// newer than this build with SchemaTooNewError (exit 4). Migration
// lives only in scripts/migrate.ts.

 *
 *  WHY THIS LIST EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM "not in SYNCED_ENTITIES"
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------
 *  "Unknown" and "known-local" are different failures and were
 *  conflated, which wedged a real fleet. A peer running a LATER (or
 *  earlier) mu wrote `entity:"marker"` ops — legal on the writer, whose
 *  SYNCED_ENTITIES included it. The reader treated every non-synced
 *  entity as a bad peer, so `ingestSegment` recorded a defect and
 *  stopped at that line FOREVER: 87% of a 20,305-line segment never
 *  applied, and `mu sync --repair` (which only resets the watermark)
 *  marched straight back into the same wall.
 *
 *  So the rule is asymmetric on purpose: an entity we know must never
 *  travel is a defect; an entity we simply do not recognise is tolerated
 *  forward-compatibly — recorded in `ops`, projected nowhere, exactly
 *  like 'message'. Reader vocabulary may lag writer vocabulary; that is
 *  a fact of a mixed fleet, not a corruption. */

 *    agents           holds `pane_id` ('%17') — meaningless elsewhere.
 *    vcs_workspaces   holds absolute paths — /home/... vs /Users/...
 *                     on a mixed macOS/Linux fleet.
 *    machine_identity IS the per-machine identity.
 *    schema_version   local bookkeeping.
 *    sync_peers       local bookkeeping (per-peer watermarks).
 *    task_substates   seeded identically on every machine from
 *                     TASK_SUBSTATE_ROWS; code, not data.
 *    ops              see below — the carrier, not cargo.
 *
 *  `ops` is listed here deliberately rather than omitted. It is not
 *  **portable** in the copy-the-table sense: the table is never
 *  wholesale-copied. Individual op ROWS ship, one at a time, filtered
 *  by SYNCED_ENTITIES and carried by per-machine **segments** — and
 *  `seq` is a local-only append cursor that means nothing on a peer.
 *  So for the only question this list answers — "is this table's
 *  content copied across machines?" — the answer for `ops` is no.
 *
 *  Consequence that falls out with no special case: `tasks.owner_id`
 *  is an FK into `agents`, and `agents` is machine-local. Therefore
 *  OWNERSHIP DOES NOT SYNC. The deleted db-sync.ts reached the same
 *  conclusion via an `includeOwners` flag; here it is structural. */
