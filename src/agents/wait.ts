// mu — waitForAgents: block until agents finish working.
//
// The off-the-cuff / scratch pattern: spawn one or more task-less
// helpers, send them work, then wait until they're done before reading
// their output. Unlike `mu task wait` (which watches the task DAG),
// scratch/subagent flows have NO task to wait on — the only signal is
// the agent's own runtime status. This is that primitive.
//
// "Done" semantics (chosen in dogfood): an agent fires when it
// transitions **busy → any other state**. The agent MUST have been
// observed `busy` first, so a helper that is already idle when the wait
// starts does NOT instantly fire — the caller is waiting for *this*
// piece of work to finish, not for "is idle right now". An agent that
// never goes busy (e.g. the prompt didn't land) just keeps the wait
// pending until timeout, which is the honest outcome.
//
// Mirrors waitForTasks' shape: poll cadence + sleep test-seam, a
// beforePoll hook so the CLI can re-detect live status each tick
// without this SDK module importing tmux, --any/--all, and a timeout.
// The CLI wrapper maps the result to task-wait-symmetric exit codes.
