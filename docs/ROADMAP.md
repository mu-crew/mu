# Roadmap

The single forward-looking doc. If a feature isn't here, it isn't
planned.

Canonical terms: [VOCABULARY.md](VOCABULARY.md). Pillars:
[VISION.md](VISION.md). Module layout:
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Shipped history:
[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Promotion criteria

A roadmap item earns implementation when **all three** are true:

1. **Proven friction.** A real user hits the missing feature in a
   real workflow at least twice. Imagined polish doesn't count.
2. **No pillar refactor.** Fits the current substrate without
   bending any pillar in [VISION.md](VISION.md).
3. **Bounded scope.** Fits in <300 LOC or has a clear smaller
   subset that does.

**Exceptions.** Data-loss footguns (silent destruction of user
artifacts) ship on the *first* occurrence. Polish — bug fixes,
ergonomic tweaks, error-message wording, doc tightening — doesn't
need promotion at all; just ship clean (typecheck + lint + tests +
build).

---

## Anti-feature pledges

We will NOT, until each one earns its way back via the criteria
above:

- **Config file.** All config is CLI flags or env vars.
- **Daemon / watcher / background process** beyond what tmux and
  SQLite give us.
- **Anticipatory abstractions** with zero current consumer (the
  cautionary tale: a `RunContext` trait with no implementor).
- **Wrappers around wrappers** (cautionary tale:
  `TextStream`/`TextState`/`StreamResult`).
- **Codegen, embedded JS engine, macros, decorators** beyond
  TypeScript itself. No workflow DSL.
- **Template/definition system for agent roles.** Spawn flags +
  the orchestrator's first message ARE the definition.
- **Render layers beyond `cli-table3` + `picocolors`**, except
  `ink` confined to `src/cli/tui/`. No second TUI stack alongside
  `ink` — if `ink` ever stops paying off, *replace* it; don't
  stack stacks.
- **Bundle pi.** It's a peer dep.
- **Plugin runtime, web UI, RPC, chat/docs integrations, memory
  system, workflow engine.** Rejected as a class — these are
  exactly the accumulations a prior internal multi-agent runtime
  collected, and not inheriting them is the point.

## Rejected sync substrates

Recorded so we don't relitigate them. mu syncs through an ops log in
SQLite plus append-only JSONL **segments**; every alternative below
was considered and rejected for the reason given.

| Substrate | Why not |
| --------- | ------- |
| **Litestream** | Daemon; single-writer; one-way to object storage; `restore` is a whole-file clobber. Solves disaster recovery, not laptop↔devserver. No answer for "I added 3 tasks on the devserver while the laptop was offline." |
| **LiteFS** | FUSE. On macOS that means macFUSE — a kernel extension needing SIP gymnastics on Apple Silicon. Dead on arrival for a mixed-OS fleet. |
| **rqlite / dqlite / Marmot** | Raft or NATS clusters. A consensus cluster to sync a task graph between two machines that are usually not both awake. Requires daemons (anti-feature pledge). |
| **cr-sqlite** | Merges rows by primary key, and every mu entity table is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` — laptop's task `id=5` and devserver's *different* task `id=5` merge into one row, column-by-column. Silent data loss. Fixing it means UUID PKs, i.e. tearing out the surrogate-PK substrate. Also: upstream still says WIP, DDL doesn't sync, and it's a native extension needing a darwin/linux × arm/x64 × glibc/musl build matrix. |
| **RocksDB / LMDB for the op log** | No triggers, so capture becomes a convention every future call site must remember — and a forgotten op is now silent corruption of undo *and* sync. Single-process-exclusive, so it forces a daemon. mu's read side is ~96 prepared statements, ~70 JOINs, 3 views and recursive CTEs — all hand-rolled. Loses `mu sql`. |
| **SQLite file per peer (instead of JSONL)** | A torn transfer makes the *whole* file unopenable, versus losing one JSONL line. `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars in a synced folder are the canonical way to corrupt a DB. Page churn defeats rsync/Syncthing delta transfer, where append-only files are the best case. |
| **`MU_SYNC_PEERS` membership list** | A config file with extra steps, and it would have to be kept consistent across every machine — the drift problem it appears to solve. Peers are discovered from segment filenames instead. |
| **`mu sync --push/--pull <host>` <!-- doc-cli-drift:skip -->** | Would make mu shell out to ssh/scp — its first network egress — dragging in ssh config, jump hosts, ProxyCommand, ports, identity files, interactive prompts, and network-vs-auth error mapping. A remote backend wearing a small hat. mu prints a copy-pasteable rsync line instead. |

The chosen design's net dependency change is **zero**: still just
`better-sqlite3`.

## Possible — small additions with an obvious shape

These have a clear design but haven't yet hit promotion criterion
1 (friction in ≥2 real workflows). They earn implementation when
real use surfaces them.

### A third mux backend (zellij, wezterm, kitty)

**Not promoted.** tmux and herdr are two real implementations, which
is what justifies `MuxBackend` existing at all — the interface was
extracted to serve a concrete second case, not in anticipation of an
nth. A third backend needs its own friction evidence under the
[promotion criteria](#promotion-criteria) like anything else. "The
abstraction already exists" is not evidence.

### Subscription-based wakeups

`mu log --tail` polls SQLite once per second. SQLite update hooks
(via better-sqlite3) or `fs.watch` on the WAL would drop latency
at the cost of more machinery. Promote when someone hits the
cliff.

---

## Open questions

Listed so we don't pretend they're settled.

- **Capability tags on operations.** mu's only authorization
  surface today is "the agent ran the verb." Promote capability
  enforcement when an agent actually does damage.
- **Per-workstream config.** Resisted (anti-feature pledge). "This
  workstream uses one pi binary, that one uses another" is a real
  gap env vars don't solve cleanly. Revisit when a second user
  hits it.

---

## murmur and remote agents

[murmur](https://github.com/mu-crew/murmur) is a separate binary for
current agent state across machines. It owns collection and ssh egress;
mu remains transport-free and owns the task DAG, claims, workspaces, and
panes.

**Done in 2.0:** mu reads murmur for agent state. See
[Agent state from murmur](specs/2026-09-28-agent-state-from-murmur.md).

---

### Next schema change

Drop the deprecated `agents.status` column at the first v11 migration.
In 2.0 it remains for schema compatibility and always contains `spawning`.

---

## Pi extension and the three rules

If a pi extension lands (typed `mu_*` tools, HUD widget, wakeups)
bundled in this same npm package, three rules stay non-negotiable:

1. **The DB is canonical.** All state in `<state-dir>/mu.db`.
   Extension reads/writes through the same modules the CLI uses.
   No extension-only state.
2. **Every operation works from the CLI.** No tool registered in
   the extension has logic that doesn't exist in the CLI.
3. **The skill teaches the CLI.** Pi sessions without the
   extension still get a working mu by following
   [skills/mu/SKILL.md](../skills/mu/SKILL.md).

If those three rules hold, mu stays driveable from a shell forever
and the extension stays thin.

---

## Explicitly rejected (one-liners)

Listed so we don't rediscover them.

- **JS / Lisp DSL** (`mu run` / `mu eval` / `mu repl`) <!-- doc-cli-drift:skip --> — bash +
  jq + `--json` covers the gap. A workflow DSL is a maintenance
  liability.
- **`defineOperation()` registry framework** — no consumer left
  after the DSL was rejected.
- **Markdown agent-definition discovery** — spawn flags + first
  message already are the definition.
- **mu as a pi extension only (no CLI)** — children couldn't drive
  mu; humans couldn't debug from a shell.
- **mu as a library only (no CLI)** — multiple processes would
  fight over the DB.
- **Two binaries (`mu-agents` + `mu-tasks`)** — agent ↔ task
  integration needs one transactional surface.
- **`TaskSurface` adapter abstraction** — the built-in graph IS
  the killer feature.
- **Live cross-machine state sync via a daemon or remote backend** —
  local-first SQLite. The ops-log sync is ambient but daemon-free
  (flush/ingest ride on ordinary mu invocations) and transport-free
  (mu reads and writes files; the user moves them). Rejected
  storage/replication substrates are in
  [§ Rejected sync substrates](#rejected-sync-substrates).
- **Network-opening remote verbs (`mu remote check`, `mu sync --push/--pull`)** <!-- doc-cli-drift:skip --> — mu manages panes and a task graph on one machine; every network hop is an operator-owned command, either passed through `agent spawn --command` for the mux to run or printed as a copy-pasteable next step. Keeping mu's own process ssh-free avoids an ssh config/auth/host/error model. Spawn does not violate this boundary: the mux, not mu, runs the operator's string.
- **HTTP API on top of SQLite** — write your own RPC if you need
  one.
- **A "hosted" mu** — your machine is the deployment.
- **Anthropomorphic agent names (`alice`, `bob`)** — use
  role-based names (`worker-1`, `reviewer-1`).
- **Pane scraping as an agent-state fallback** — absence of a state source is `unknown`, not a guessed state.
- **Storing runtime agent state in `mu.db`** — the copy goes stale; murmur or herdr owns the current reading.
- **Reading murmur's `state.db`** — use murmur's stable public contract, not its private schema.
- **murmur as a hard dependency** — installs that only use the task graph do not need murmur or its native dependencies.
