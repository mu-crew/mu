# VISION: A persistent crew of agents

> Terminology used in this doc is canonical. See
> [VOCABULARY.md](VOCABULARY.md) for definitions of *workstream*,
> *agent*, *task DAG*, *crew*, *track*, *claim*, *free*, *workspace*,
> and the rest.

## What This Is

mu is a small, durable **control plane** for a persistent crew of AI
agents in multiplexer panes. Agents have names, roles, and status; they live
across sessions; they work on a built-in task graph with VCS
workspace isolation; humans and other agents drive them through one
CLI. State lives in one SQLite file; every mu feature is a typed verb
over that state or a reconciled view of reality.

```bash
mu agent spawn worker-1   --tab Backend --workspace
mu agent spawn reviewer-1 --tab Review  --workspace --role read-only
mu task add --title "Build auth" --impact 80 --effort-days 3
mu task claim build_auth --for worker-1 --evidence "have implementation plan"
mu agent send worker-1 "Implement build_auth per the description"
mu state                                # canonical state card
mu log --tail                           # subscribe to every state change
```

That's the whole product. Everything else makes those few lines work,
recover from failure, and scale to dozens of agents and hundreds of
tasks.

---

## Why It Exists

Existing tools force a choice:

- **Hidden subagents** (pi-subagents, the Claude Code and Codex task
  tools) delegate one-shot work to a child you cannot see, steer, or
  keep talking to; its transcript collapses into a result.
- **Tmux-orchestration tools** spawn agents in panes but leave
  coordination to chat transcripts or filesystem conventions.
- **Task trackers** (GitHub Issues, Linear, even tg) model the work but
  don't run the agents.
- **Bigger orchestration platforms** carry the coordination state but
  have accumulated breadth that costs more in maintenance than it
  pays for. See
  [§ What looking at a prior multi-agent runtime taught us](#what-looking-at-a-prior-multi-agent-runtime-taught-us).

mu unifies the first three without becoming the fourth: persistent
pi agents, a structured work graph, per-agent VCS isolation, one
CLI, one SQLite file. "What should this agent do next?" becomes:

```bash
mu task next            # top ready task by ROI
mu state                # full picture as a JSON state card
```

---

## Design Principles

### 1. The CLI is the product

The pi extension is a UX skin. Everything mu does must work from a
shell with no pi anywhere. A feature that requires the extension
doesn't ship.

Delegation is CLI: `mu agent spawn -w scratch` + `mu agent send` +
`mu agent wait --json`. The `mu_delegate` tool adds only the callback
that puts the answer into the parent conversation, and that is
presentation.

### 2. One DB is canonical

All state lives in `~/.local/state/mu/mu.db`. SQLite WAL; multiple
processes share it safely. The DB is the source of truth; in-memory
state is a cache. The extension and the CLI go through the same DB,
so they never diverge.

### 2b. One log records every change

There is exactly **one** record of change: the `ops` table, written by
SQLite triggers inside the same transaction as the mutation they
record. Same file, same transaction — so capture cannot be forgotten
and cannot drift from the data, even on power loss.

**Sync, undo, rebuild, and history are all queries or replays over
that one log.**

The tables stay canonical for **reads** — this is not an event-sourced
system that replays to answer a query. Ops are the durable change
record; the tables are the materialized view; triggers keep them in
lockstep. `mu doctor` rebuilds into a temp DB and diffs, so the
lockstep is verified rather than assumed.

The cost: a capture bug is not "sync is broken", it is "undo and
rebuild are also broken". The drift check is load-bearing.

### 2c. Local-first, transport-agnostic

Every machine keeps its own complete DB. Machines exchange
append-only JSONL **segments** — one per machine, single-writer, so no
file is ever contended and any file-mover (Syncthing, rsync, scp,
git, a USB stick) is adequate transport. mu reads and writes files;
**the user owns transport**. mu has no network code, no daemon, and
no membership config — peers are discovered from the segment files
present.

### 3. Reality wins reconciliation

`mu agent list` queries the mux, prunes ghosts, surfaces orphans. The DB
records what we last observed, not what we wish were true. If
worker-1's pane crashed, the next `mu agent list` notices.

### 4. Agents are dumb workers; the task graph is the brain

The **task DAG is the central organizing primitive**, not a sidecar
feature. Tasks have mandatory `impact` and `effort_days`; edges are
`blocks` relationships; `ready`/`blocked`/`goals` are SQL views; the
parallel-track detector runs union-find with automatic diamond-merge
so two agents never collide on a shared dependency.

"What should this agent do next?" and "can we parallelize?" are
deterministic queries against the graph, not LLM judgment calls. The
LLM decides *what to type to the agent*; the graph decides *which
agent gets which task*.

### 5. One workstream per mux session

A mu workstream is a **mux session** — a tmux session on the tmux
backend, a herdr workspace on the herdr backend. All its agents are
panes/windows inside that session. `tmux a -t mu-<workstream>` shows
the whole crew live. Multiple workstreams on one machine are multiple
isolated mux sessions, partitioned in the DB by `session_id`. Detach
and reattach as you would any tmux session — the crew survives.

The multiplexer is a **backend**, chosen by detection
(`MU_MUX` → `HERDR_ENV` → `$TMUX` → `PATH`), the same shape as the
VCS backend. Everything backend-specific — topology, the send
protocol, scrollback capture, pane-id validation, identity fallback —
lives behind `MuxBackend` in `src/mux/`. Two implementations, not an
anticipatory abstraction: a third earns its way in on its own
friction evidence.

### 6. Pi-first, with reported agent state

mu does not infer agent state from pane text. The herdr backend reports
state through the mux. On tmux, murmur's pi extension reports state from
inside the agent process; without murmur, state is `unknown` with a reason.

`--cli` and `MU_<UPPER_CLI>_COMMAND` stay useful for swapping the pi
binary: set `MU_PI_COMMAND=<name>` once and every spawn picks it up.
Multi-word commands work: `MU_PI_COMMAND="pi-alt --some-flag"`.

Multi-CLI support (claude / codex with real detection) is not
planned. The substrate is ready if it earns promotion per the
[ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) criteria: spawn accepts arbitrary commands and
the schema's `cli` column is TEXT.

### 7. TypeScript on Node

Mu is TypeScript on Node, with a small set of well-established
npm deps (`commander`, `better-sqlite3`, `cli-table3`, `picocolors`,
`execa`). No native code we maintain, no build matrix. Anyone
reading `package.json` should recognize every name.

The choice earns its keep on four axes:

- **The type system pays.** The `AgentNotFoundError` /
  `TaskNotFoundError` / `TaskNotInWorkstreamError` / `CycleError`
  hierarchy maps to exit codes via `handle()`; the
  `assertXInWorkstream` family stays type-safe across every
  namespace; `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` has caught real bugs. Go
  loses the discriminated unions, Python's checker is too weak,
  Rust costs 2–3× the LOC.
- **JSON-first surface fits TS.** Every read verb's `--json` output
  is `JSON.stringify(value)` straight from a typed shape.
- **`better-sqlite3` fits the shape.** Synchronous
  request/response matches the CLI invocation model; WAL correct out
  of the box; `db.transaction()` is the right shape.
- **Iteration speed.** ~60 typed verbs / 10 tables / ~2900 tests
  (`npm run test`) in ~95k LOC src+tests (`wc -l` over `src/` and
  `test/`), with multiple substantive changes per day. That cadence
  in an equivalent Rust codebase would be 2–3× slower.

**Where it's weak: cold start.** Node's V8 init is ~30–50ms even
after tsup bundles (Rust ~5ms, Go ~10–15ms). That would matter if
mu were called in tight loops, but the docs steer operators away
from polling toward `mu log --tail`. If that stops being true, Rust
is the natural port target.

**Native dep:** `better-sqlite3` requires prebuilds or a C++
toolchain. Prebuilds cover darwin-arm64/x64, linux-x64/arm64,
win32-x64 — every dev workstation we care about. Acceptable.

### 8. Schema-first; typed verbs over read views; SQL as escape hatch

The product surface is:

- **Read views** (the `ready` / `blocked` / `goals` SQL views; `mu
  state` as the curated state card) for inspection.
- **Typed verbs** that map cleanly to resource transitions for action
  (`task add`, `task claim`, `task close`, `agent spawn --workspace`,
  `workstream init`, `workstream destroy`, ...).
- **`--json` on every read verb** so scripts pipe through `jq`
  instead of parsing tables.
- **`mu sql`** as the explicit escape hatch underneath.

There is no DSL, no plugin system, no workflow engine, no
`defineOperation` registry generating verbs from declarations. The
commander wiring in `src/cli.ts` is the single source of truth for
the verb surface. Adding a new verb is one SDK function plus one
commander block.

### 9. Observed vs claimed

When a verb mutates state, the audit trail records what the caller
said it relied on. `mu task close design --evidence "tests pass:
npm test exit 0"` lands in the ops log as
`task status design (IN_PROGRESS → CLOSED) evidence="..."`. The verb
still trusts the caller — mu doesn't run tests for you — but the
grounding for every state change is searchable via `mu log`.

### 10. Get out of the model's way

Mu coordinates agents; it does not reason about them. Specifically,
mu does not own:

- **Model selection.** No tier abstraction, no provider matrix, no
  vendor-name mapping. Pi already speaks `--model sonnet:high` and
  `--provider openai`. Inventing tier names would mean owning a
  vendor matrix that goes stale every quarter.
- **Effort / thinking levels.** Pi has
  `--thinking off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`. Mu doesn't wrap
  it, doesn't normalise it, doesn't second-guess it. Pass-through
  via `--command` or the `MU_<UPPER_CLI>_COMMAND` env var, full stop.
- **Prompt engineering.** Mu has no system-prompt templating, no
  role injection beyond the agent name and `--role`, no "agent
  template" registry. The system prompt is whatever you put in the
  spawn command and the first message you send.
- **Tool routing decisions.** Pi (and any other CLI you spawn) owns
  tool allowlists, MCP servers, extensions. Mu doesn't proxy or
  inspect them.
- **Output interpretation.** Mu does not parse pane contents for agent
  state, facts, claims, or tool calls. murmur or herdr reports runtime
  agent state.
  The `--evidence` payload is whatever the agent says it is; mu
  records it without interpretation.

The full mechanism is one function: `--cli <key>` uppercases the
key and looks up `$MU_<KEY>_COMMAND`. That's mu's entire vendor
surface. The operator pattern when you want different models per
role is just convention on top:

```bash
export MU_PI_MINI_COMMAND="pi --model haiku:off"   # → --cli pi_mini
export MU_PI_BIG_COMMAND="pi --model opus:high"    # → --cli pi_big

mu agent spawn worker-1   --cli pi_mini
mu agent spawn reviewer-1 --cli pi_big
```

Your shell rc owns the mapping. The names `pi_mini` / `pi_big` are
operator convention — mu doesn't know about "tiers," it just looks
up whatever env var the uppercased key produces. Swap the whole
matrix in one line; per-machine, per-workstream, per project —
wherever you set the env. The substrate stays small; the
orchestrator stays in charge.

---

## What It Enables

- **Persistent crews in one place** — Spawn worker-1/worker-2/reviewer-1
  once, send them work all day. `tmux a -t mu-<workstream>` shows
  the whole crew: each agent in its own pane, observable, detachable.
- **Graph-driven coordination** — The task DAG answers "what's ready?",
  "what blocks what?", "what can be parallelized?" with SQL queries
  and union-find, not LLM guesses. Task notes accumulate durable
  context that outlives any single agent or session.
- **Deterministic parallelization** — Diamond patterns (shared
  prerequisites) get merged automatically so two agents never collide
  on a shared dependency. The orchestrator follows the algorithm; it
  doesn't have to be smart enough to spot the trap.
- **VCS workspace isolation** — Each agent gets its own jj workspace,
  sl clone, git worktree, or `cp -a` snapshot, auto-detected.
  `mu agent spawn --workspace` creates and mounts; `mu agent close`
  auto-frees. Two parallel agents in the same project never trample
  each other's working tree.
- **Async coordination via `mu log`** — Every state-changing verb
  writes an op. Subscribers `mu log --tail` instead of polling.
  Wakeups without a daemon.
- **Audit trail with grounding** — `--evidence` on lifecycle verbs
  records what the caller observed, searchable via `mu log`.
- **Crash recovery** — Reconciliation prunes ghost agents; the reaper
  reverts their IN_PROGRESS tasks to OPEN with an explanatory note;
  no manual cleanup.
- **Human-driveable** — Anything mu can do, you can do from a shell.
  Debug, recover, script, cron.

---

## What It Is NOT

- **Not an orchestrator.** mu provides primitives. The orchestration
  *policy* (when to spawn, what to assign, when to free) is yours —
  expressed as bash scripts, jq pipelines over `--json` output, or
  driven by an LLM through the bundled skill. There is no JS DSL,
  no workflow engine, no `mu run script.ts`. <!-- doc-cli-drift:skip --> (See
  [§ What looking at a prior multi-agent runtime taught us](#what-looking-at-a-prior-multi-agent-runtime-taught-us).)
- **Not a build tool.** mu doesn't compile, test, or deploy your code.
  It runs agents that do those things.
- **Not a chat protocol.** Agents communicate through the work graph
  (notes, claim, status) and the **ops log** read through `mu log`.
- **Not a hidden-subagent runner.** A one-shot **delegate** is an
  ordinary agent in a visible pane: attach, steer, abort, or keep
  talking to it. The cost is one pane and one pi process per delegate;
  a hidden subagent is lighter for many tiny calls. mu bets that
  visibility and steering are worth that for agent work. No agent
  types: the brief is ad-hoc text.
- **Not a hosted service.** Local-first SQLite. Zero ops, no accounts.
  Your machine is the deployment.
- **Not a verifier.** The verbs trust the caller. `task close
  --evidence "tests pass"` records the claim; mu doesn't run the
  tests. Verification is the caller's job. (mu may grow optional
  verifying-runners later if friction surfaces; today it's an
  audit-trail discipline, not enforcement.)
- **DB-undoable, not substrate-undoable.** `mu undo <group> --yes`
  emits inverse ops for one action and restores the rows. It does not
  replay killed mux panes or recreate freed workspace directories;
  after an undo, reconciliation reports ghosts/orphans and the caller
  decides what to re-spawn or adopt.

---

## Key Constraints

1. **A multiplexer is required.** The substrate is mux panes — tmux or
   herdr. No multiplexer, no agents. `mu doctor` reports the resolved
   backend and its version; verbs that touch the agent layer fail with
   exit 5 when none is reachable.

2. **Local-first persistence.** SQLite file at
   `~/.local/state/mu/mu.db`. Cross-machine state moves as
   append-only JSONL segments in a shared folder; you own transport.

3. **Pi-first.** `--cli pi` is the meaningful default; `--cli` accepts
   other strings as a key for the `MU_<UPPER_CLI>_COMMAND` env var
   resolver. Agent state comes from murmur on tmux and herdr on herdr;
   absence is `unknown` rather than an inferred value.

4. **Send is delivered, not acknowledged.** `mu agent send` gets the
   text into the pane and warns loudly when it cannot confirm
   submission, but the AGENT never acknowledges receipt.
   Orchestrators poll status or subscribe to
   `mu log --tail` for confirmation. This is by design — the
   alternative requires a protocol every CLI would have to speak.

5. **Recursion is opt-in.** The `mu_delegate` tool is hidden in
   agents mu spawned (`MU_MANAGED_AGENT`), so a delegate cannot spawn
   delegates through it. Agents get the `mu` binary on PATH, but the
   bundled skill says "you are not the orchestrator."

6. **Subscriptions are polling-based.** `mu log --tail` polls
   SQLite once per second. SQLite handles the concurrency; latency
   is bounded by the poll interval. Real subscription mechanisms
   (SQLite hooks, fs.watch) are a future ask if anyone hits the
   latency cliff.

7. **Every invocation is short-lived — except for two named
   interactive readers.** mu is a CLI: each verb starts, mutates
   or reads, prints, and exits. There is no daemon, no resident
   state outside SQLite, no background process. Two verbs are
   exempt, narrowly, because they are interactive *readers* rather
   than background workers:

   - `mu log --tail` — polls SQLite once per second; emits NDJSON
     until SIGINT or the parent closes stdin.
   - the TUI dashboard — rendered by `mu state --tui` explicitly or
     by bare `mu` when stdout is attached to a TTY, until the user
     quits with `q`/`Ctrl-C`. Plain `mu state` keeps the static-card
     behaviour; non-TTY bare `mu` prints help instead of entering Ink.

   Both share the same shape, and the shape is the predicate that
   bounds the exception:

   - **Interactive, not a daemon.** The process is owned by a
     human (or a parent script) and dies the moment that owner
     ends it. Nothing keeps it alive across sessions; nothing
     restarts it.
   - **Read-only against SQLite.** Neither verb writes. The TUI's
     act-intents (claim, close, send, ...) yank the canonical
     `mu <verb>` command into the clipboard and exit the
     dashboard; every mutation still lands through a fresh
     short-lived CLI invocation.
   - **No resources beyond stdout, stdin, and a poll timer.** No
     sockets, no file watches, no subscriptions to external
     services, no spawned subprocesses, no inter-process state
     beyond the SQLite reads any other CLI invocation already
     does.
   - **Human-TTY gated, with static/script fallbacks.** The TUI mode
     activates when `--tui` is passed to `mu state` or when bare `mu`
     sees `process.stdout.isTTY === true`. Default `mu state` prints
     the static card. Non-interactive callers (pipes, CI, `--json`, or
     `MU_NO_TUI=1`) never enter the TUI.

   This is not a precedent for any other long-lived process. The
   anti-feature pledges in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) remain in force;
   a third member of this exception class needs its own promotion.

## What looking at a prior multi-agent runtime taught us

A five-role council critique of a prior internal multi-agent runtime
— mu's design ancestor — converged on a sharp central claim:

> [The runtime] is not justified as a better general coding harness.
> [The runtime] is justified only when it becomes a durable
> coordination/control plane for work that outgrows a thin harness
> plus manually managed tmux.

And a sharper recommendation for what such a control plane should
look like:

> A minimal defensible core would be: durable sessions/transcripts;
> agent registry; task records / task graph; workspace and checkout
> ownership/leases; event log; wakeups/timers; human approvals/input;
> typed control API; read-only views/state cards; recovery/orphan
> detection.
>
> Everything else — chat, docs, IDE assist, incident-triage,
> mobile-agent, end-to-end workflows, memory policy, rich
> dashboards, workflow DSLs — should be optional layers that prove
> they strengthen the supervision loop.

Nine of the ten items in that minimal core ship in mu; almost every
item the council criticised is something mu does not have.

### The council's criticisms → mu's design choices

| Council critique of the prior runtime                         | mu's stance                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Sprawling product identities (TUI + web + Thrift + plugin host + workflow engine + chat + docs + memory + ...)" | One CLI, one SQLite file, no plugins, no web UI, no Thrift, no chat/docs integrations. |
| "Workflow DSL is mostly liability"                            | Rejected outright. No `mu run`/`eval`/`repl`. <!-- doc-cli-drift:skip --> `--json` + bash + jq cover the scripting story. |
| "defineOperation/verb-registry adds entropy without consumers" | Rejected. The commander wiring in `src/cli.ts` is the verb surface; one place. |
| "Plugin sprawl with hidden state and lifecycle bugs"          | No plugins. Adding behaviour is a typed verb in `src/cli.ts`.              |
| "CLI verbs as a primary model surface vs. typed mutations"    | mu's verbs *are* the typed mutations. CLI is a thin wrapper over a typed SDK with idempotency, validation, exit-code-mapped errors. |
| "Raw SQL as the only inspection surface is too low-level"     | `mu state` is the canonical state card. `--json` everywhere. `mu sql` is the escape hatch beneath, not the cockpit. |
| "Distinguish observed from claimed state"                     | `--evidence` on lifecycle verbs (first inch). The verb still trusts the caller; the audit trail records grounding. |
| "Approval primitives belong in the core"                      | Not in mu: dogfood across 200+ tasks produced zero calls for them. Anti-anticipatory pruning per "no traits with zero implementors". May earn promotion when a real implementor surfaces (e.g. an unattended pi-orchestrator running mu). |
| "Reads must distinguish provenance (process telemetry vs agent self-report)" | event `source` field attributes events to actor (claiming agent / decider / 'system'). |
| "State must be authoritative and recoverable, not just durable" | Reconciliation runs on read paths; reaper recovers stuck IN_PROGRESS automatically. |

### What this validates

1. **The anti-feature pledges hold.** No DSL, no plugins,
   no daemon, no config file, no web UI. Each is a failure mode the
   prior runtime exhibited and mu chose not to inherit.

2. **"Pi+tmux is the benchmark" is the right comparison.** mu only
   earns its complexity above the threshold where coordination
   itself is the work — multiple agents, multiple checkouts, delayed
   wakeups, recovery, approvals. Below that, a thin harness with
   manual tmux is more transparent.

3. **Schema-first + typed verbs + state cards is the right model UX
   shape** — independent reasoning from operators, engineers,
   architects, and model-UX specialists converges on it.

### What this still flags as gaps

The critique cuts mu too:

- **Wakeups are polling-based.** `mu log --tail` polls every 1s.
  Real subscriptions (SQLite update hooks) are deferred.
- **`--evidence` is grounding, not verification.** mu doesn't run the
  tests. A future `--verify-by` mode that runs a command and records
  its exit could deepen this; not built yet.
- **No idempotency keys on mutations.** Most ops are idempotent by
  happenstance; not declared as part of the API contract.
- **No dry-run on most mutations.** `workstream destroy`, `task delete`, and `undo` have it; most other mutating verbs apply immediately.
- **No capability model.** The `role` field is stored on agent rows
  but unused. No "reviewer-1 cannot delete tasks" enforcement.

Each is a known gap with a clear shape; none has earned promotion.
