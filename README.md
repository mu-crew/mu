# mu

**A small, opinionated control plane for a crew of AI coding agents
working in parallel.** Tmux panes, a typed task DAG, isolated VCS
workspaces per agent, an audit log — and a dashboard for seeing what
the crew is doing right now.

![mu dashboard](docs/img/tui-dashboard.png)

*`mu` (no args) — read-only dashboard: agents, tracks, ready /
in-progress / blocked tasks, log tail, workspaces, doctor.*

The core loop is: plan work as a DAG, spawn a small crew, and watch
handoffs happen in tmux:

```bash
mu workstream init auth-refactor
mu task add --title "Design auth" --impact 80 --effort-days 2
mu task add --title "Build auth"  --impact 80 --effort-days 5 --blocked-by design_auth

mu agent spawn worker-1 --workspace
mu agent send worker-1 'Pick up the next ready task and design the auth module.'
mu                         # dashboard
```

Need one quick helper without the DAG? `mu agent spawn scout-1 -w
scratch` gives you a low-ceremony agent you can still send/read/wait
on.

Nothing here is a black box. Agents are multiplexer panes you can
attach to yourself, tasks live in a SQLite DAG, and workspaces are real
jj workspaces / sl shares / git worktrees on disk. **mu persists state
and coordinates handoffs; the model still decides what to do.**

For the full copy-paste flow, see [Quick start](#quick-start).

## What mu is

mu excels at organising large pieces of work and keeping your agents
on track.

- **Parallelism that doesn't trip over itself.** Per-agent VCS
  workspaces plus a task DAG with deterministic parallel-track
  detection keep agents off each other's toes.
- **A durable coordination layer.** One SQLite registry records
  agents, tasks, ownership, notes and workspaces. A single
  append-only **ops log** records every change ever made to them, so
  panes can die and humans can come back later.
- **Stay out of the model's way.** Mu coordinates handoffs; it does
  not choose models, providers, or thinking effort. `--cli <key>`
  uppercases to `$MU_<KEY>_COMMAND`, so your shell rc owns the agent
  command.
- **Scriptable without scraping text.** Every read path that matters has
  `--json`, and every state change goes through a typed CLI verb; the
  dashboard is for humans, not the API.
- **A low-ceremony escape hatch.** The reserved `scratch` workstream
  is there when you want one driveable helper without committing to a
  full task graph.

## What mu is NOT

- **Not a build tool.** mu doesn't compile, test, or deploy
  anything.
- **Not a chat protocol.** Agents communicate via the work graph
  and the activity log, never agent-to-agent messaging.
- **Not a verifier.** `task close --evidence "tests pass"` records
  the claim; mu doesn't run the tests.
- **Not a replacement for [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents).**
  Mu agents are driveable panes; pi-subagents is for one-shot
  focused delegation. See [vs `pi-subagents`](#vs-pi-subagents).
- **Not a hosted service.** Local-first SQLite.
- **DB-undoable, not substrate-undoable.** Every change is captured as ops
  under one group, so `mu undo <group> --yes` reverses exactly that
  one action — not your other workstreams. Killed panes and freed
  workspace dirs are NOT replayed; they aren't portable state.

---

## When mu earns its overhead

mu pays off when the work is bigger than one agent's context: many
steps, dependencies between them, several agents, or a job that runs
for days. The DAG holds the plan, so no single agent has to. Each
agent claims one ready task, works in its own workspace, writes notes
on the task as it goes (findings, decisions, dead ends), and closes
it with evidence. Every claim, note and close is appended to the
audit log. If an agent drifts, stalls, or loses its pane, the plan,
the notes, and the history of who did what are still there. You, or
the next agent, pick up where it stopped instead of explaining
everything again.

**Use mu for** — multi-phase investigations; tasks worth gating with
review; parallel audit or implementation/reviewer splits with isolated
workspaces; anything where "what was decided and why" needs to outlive
a single agent's scrollback. Use `scratch` for the lighter adjacent
case: one helper or background watcher you still want to drive and
observe.

**Don't use mu for** — tiny direct edits; quick local inspection;
one-shot focused delegation where you only need a returned answer
(use `pi-subagents`); single-context work where durable coordination
adds ceremony.

## Install

```bash
# 1. The CLI, and murmur for agent state on tmux (see below).
npm install -g @mu-crew/mu @mu-crew/murmur
mu --version
murmur init && murmur link pi

# 2. The skill (teaches your coding agent how to drive mu).
npx skills add mu-crew/mu          # auto-detects pi / claude-code / codex / etc.
# Add -g to install globally (~/.<agent>/skills/), -y to skip prompts.
```

**Requirements:**
- Node 22.12–26 (see `.nvmrc`), matching `engines` in `package.json`.
- A terminal multiplexer: tmux ≥ 3.0, or [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr)
  (`mu doctor` reports which one is active). Spawn, send, and read work
  on both. Agent state comes from herdr on herdr and from murmur on tmux;
  the remaining herdr gaps are listed in
  [docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md § 20](docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md#20-multiplexer-backends-tmux-and-herdr).
- pi (the agent CLI mu orchestrates)
- For `--workspace`: jj, sl, or git on PATH (or `--backend none`)

**Agent state on tmux needs [murmur](https://github.com/mu-crew/murmur),
even on one machine.** mu owns the work; murmur reports what each agent is
doing. mu does not read panes itself, so without murmur every agent's state
is `unknown`, and everything built on state goes quiet: `mu agent wait`
never fires, `mu task wait --stuck-after` / `--on-stall exit` never detects
a worker waiting on you, and spawn skips its readiness check. Tasks, claims,
`mu task wait` on status, workspaces, spawn and send still work. murmur also
provides one attention-sorted list across machines and owns the ssh egress.

```bash
# on every node that runs agents
npm install -g @mu-crew/murmur
murmur init          # this node's identity
murmur link pi       # the agent-side extension that reports state

# then, on whichever machine you watch from
murmur peer add dev  # an ssh target; identity is discovered
murmur peer list     # which hosts are reachable, and when last seen
```

mu exports `MU_MANAGED_AGENT`, `MU_AGENT_NAME`, and `MU_WORKSTREAM`
into every pane it spawns. murmur uses them to identify crew agents.
See murmur's [stable contract](https://github.com/mu-crew/murmur/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#contract).

**Update:** `npm install -g @mu-crew/mu@latest` for the CLI;
`npx skills update mu` for the skill.

**Install from source** (hacking on mu itself):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mu-crew/mu
cd mu
npm install -g .                        # `prepare` script auto-builds; `mu` lands on $PATH
npx skills add ./skills/mu              # local-path source format
```

## TUI dashboard

Bare `mu` in a TTY launches the read-only dashboard across all
workstreams; `mu state --tui -w <workstream>` is the explicit
single/multi-workstream form. Non-TTY callers and scripts keep the
static/help path, and `mu state --json` is the API.

The dashboard has ten cards: Commits, Agents, Tracks, Ready, Activity
log, Workspaces, In-progress, Blocked, Recent, and Doctor. Drill into
any numbered card fullscreen with `Shift+0`-`Shift+9`; `g` opens the
full DAG and `t` opens the all-tasks list. `?` shows the complete
keymap. Keyboard and mouse both work: navigate with keys, double-click
cards or rows to drill, and scroll popup bodies with the mouse wheel.

The TUI is read-only by design. `y` yanks the canonical `mu` command
for the focused row to your clipboard; you run it in a shell, so every
mutation still goes through a short-lived typed CLI invocation. The
one exception is user-driven: `t` inside a commit/show drill suspends
mu's alt-screen and hands off to `tuicr -r <sha>`, then restores the
dashboard when tuicr exits.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Make sure you're inside a multiplexer. tmux is the common path;
# herdr works too (mu picks whichever it detects).
tmux

# Initialize the workstream (creates mux session mu-auth-refactor)
mu workstream init auth-refactor

# Plan the work as a DAG. IDs auto-derive from titles.
mu task add --title "Design auth module" --impact 80 --effort-days 2
mu task add --title "Build auth"         --impact 80 --effort-days 5 --blocked-by design_auth_module
mu task add --title "Review auth"        --impact 60 --effort-days 1 --blocked-by build_auth

# Spawn a crew with isolated workspaces.
mu agent spawn worker-1   --workspace
mu agent spawn reviewer-1 --workspace --role read-only

# Human home base: interactive read-only TUI across every workstream
# (same dashboard is explicit with: mu state --tui -w auth-refactor).
mu

# Agent/script API: static state stays explicit and JSON-friendly.
mu state -w auth-refactor --json

# Inside an agent's pane, the agent claims and closes tasks
# without ever knowing its own name (mu reads $TMUX_PANE).
mu task claim design_auth_module
mu task note  design_auth_module "DECISION: JWT, 24h expiry, refresh via cookie"
mu task close design_auth_module --evidence "design doc reviewed by reviewer-1"

# Subscribe to events instead of polling.
mu log --tail

# Cleanup. Dry-run without --yes; writes tombstone ops rather than
# erasing history, so `mu undo <group> --yes` still reverses it.
mu workstream teardown --yes
```

## Portability and handoff

State lives in one SQLite DB, and every change to it is captured as an
op in an append-only log — so it travels, and it merges.

### Multi-machine sync

Each machine keeps its own DB. They exchange append-only JSONL
segments through any folder something else keeps in step (Syncthing,
rsync, a USB stick — mu never runs the transport). Setup is one env
var on each machine; there is no peer list, no daemon, no import step,
and concurrent edits on two machines converge.

```bash
export MU_SYNC_DIR=$HOME/Sync/mu   # same folder on every machine
mu task add auth_fix -w app -t "Fix the auth redirect" -i 80 -e 2
#   → the next `mu` command on the other machine already sees it
mu sync                            # peer status, if you want to check
```

**Never put `MU_DB_PATH` inside `MU_SYNC_DIR`** — a live WAL database
is three mutually-consistent files and a file-syncer will corrupt it.
`mu doctor` fails on it. Full walkthrough:
[USAGE_GUIDE § Multi-machine sync](docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md#156-multi-machine-sync).

For disaster recovery, `mu rebuild <file>` replays the whole ops log
into a fresh DB and prints the swap command; `mu undo <group>` reverts
one past action by emitting inverse ops.

For a safety copy before anything destructive, `mu db backup <file>`
writes a `VACUUM INTO` copy of the whole DB. To read the graph out for
review or grep, every verb takes `--json`.

### Remote workers

An agent can run on another machine with no mu changes and no remote
backend: the pane is local, the process is remote.

```bash
ssh dev 'git -C ~/repo worktree add ~/ws/worker-1'
mu agent spawn worker-1 -w big --command \
  'ssh dev -t "cd ~/ws/worker-1 && pi --approve"'
# ... claim and send exactly as for a local agent, then collect:
git fetch "ssh://dev/~/ws/worker-1" HEAD && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
```

Local and remote agents mix freely in one workstream. You create the
remote workspace yourself (`--workspace` is local-only) and mu keeps
no record of it, so read
[skills/mu/REMOTE_WORKERS.md](skills/mu/REMOTE_WORKERS.md) first — it
covers the traps, including the one where your own agent blocks your
`git fetch` behind a misleading `Permission denied`.

## vs `pi-subagents`

|                          | [`pi-subagents`](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents) | `mu` |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Best for                 | "Send this focused task to a specialist, return a result" | "Keep a driveable agent/persistent crew in a multiplexer" |
| Lifetime                 | one-shot per task                                        | from off-the-cuff `scratch` helper to long-lived crew |
| Substrate                | `pi` subprocess + result files                           | tmux/herdr panes running pi sessions |
| Built-in task graph      | no                                                       | yes: parallel-tracks union-find with diamond-merge |
| Drivable from outside pi | no (extension-only)                                      | yes (`mu` is a real CLI) |

The two play well together. Use `pi-subagents` when you want one
focused answer back. Use mu's reserved `scratch` workstream when you
want a low-ceremony helper you can keep talking to. For coordinated
multi-agent work, graduate from `scratch` to a named workstream + task
DAG. See [docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md](docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md).
