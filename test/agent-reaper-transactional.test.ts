// Regression test for `review_substrate_delete_agent_not_transactional`:
// the reaper sequence inside `deleteAgent` (snapshot stuck tasks → DELETE
// agent row → per-task UPDATE + addNote + emitEvent) MUST run inside a
// single SQLite transaction. If a throw escapes mid-loop (e.g. addNote
// hits a NOT NULL regression, FK race after workstream teardown, OOM),
// the whole sequence MUST roll back — agent row still present, every
// stuck task still claimed by it, no `task reap` event leaked. Without
// the transaction wrapper, the agent row would already be DELETEd (FK
// CASCADE clears tasks.owner_id) but only PART of the reaper trail
// would be written: leftover IN_PROGRESS tasks with no owner and no
// `[reaper]` note explaining how they got there.
