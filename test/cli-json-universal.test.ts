// Regression test: every program.command() in src/cli.ts accepts --json.
//
// Skill cleanup wants to assert "every mu verb supports --json" in
// SKILL.md. This test guards that invariant against drift: adding a
// new verb without --json breaks the build.
//
// Implementation: drive the actual buildProgram() output and walk the
// commander tree recursively. Replaces an earlier regex-on-source
// audit (review_test_json_universal_regex_drift) which had three
// known false-positive paths:
//   1. Verbs nested under a parent command whose body absorbed the
//      regex match.
//   2. Verbs that build --json via a helper named differently from
//      `JSON_OPT` or the literal "--json".
//   3. Renaming the JSON_OPT identifier silently broke the audit
//      without breaking the audited behaviour.
//
// The new walk asserts on commander's actual parsed option list — the
// invariant we ACTUALLY care about ("commander accepts --json on this
// verb") rather than a textual proxy.
