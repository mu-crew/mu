// Shared helper for the doc/CLI drift guard (test/docs-cli-drift.test.ts).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Two doc/code divergences in the 1.0 arc were caught by a human
// running a documented command, not by any test: VOCABULARY § portable
// omitted two tables, and a removed option remained documented. Both
// are the same failure
// shape: prose that names a verb or flag the CLI no longer has. That is
// mechanically checkable, so it should not need a human.
//
// The check walks commander's OWN command tree rather than shelling out
// to `--help` per snippet: the tree is the same object the CLI parses
// with, it is ~200x faster than N subprocesses, and it keeps the guard
// in the fast tier.
//
// SCOPE, deliberately narrow: a documented command must NAME a real
// verb path and pass only KNOWN flags. It is not a semantic check —
// argument counts, value shapes, and mutually-exclusive combinations
// are the CLI's own job at runtime. A guard that tried to be a second
// parser would drift from the first one.
