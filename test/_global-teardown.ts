// Global vitest setup/teardown hook.
//
// Two layers stacked here, both from bug_test_suite_flake_leaks_isolation:
//
//   LAYER 3 (the real fix) — ONE dedicated `tmux -L <socket>` server per
//   `npm test` invocation. The integration suite never touches the user's
//   default tmux socket (the one `tmux ls` in their interactive shell
//   shows). Two concurrent `npm test` runs (orchestrator + worker agent)
//   pick different sockets and can't possibly contend on session names.
//   The user's interactive sessions are invisible to the suite, and
//   suite-residue is invisible to the user.
//
//   LAYER 2 (round-4 — DB-rooted allowlist) — a safety net for any
//   test that bypasses the private socket and accidentally creates a
//   session on the user's DEFAULT socket. The sweep computes an
//   allowlist of names we MUST NEVER kill — every workstream name in
//   the user's real DB plus the orchestrator's own `$MU_SESSION` — and
//   kills any other `mu-*` session on the default socket.
//
//   Round-3 Part B used the same approach but ALSO captured a snapshot
//   of `mu-*` sessions present at module-load time. That snapshot is
//   gone (round-4 — bug_test_flake_round_4_self_heal): leftover test
//   residue from a partially-broken run on the user's default socket
//   would get "grandfathered in" as protected forever, defeating the
//   self-healing intent of the sweep. The DB is the only source of
//   truth for what the user considers a real workstream; an ad-hoc
//   `tmux new-session -t mu-foo` with no DB row is now killed by the
//   sweep (the user can `mu workstream init foo` to register it,
//   which they'd need to do anyway to use it as a workstream).
//
// CONTRACT
//
// vitest's globalSetup contract: this file exports `setup()` (runs once
// before the suite) and `teardown()` (runs once after). Both are async.
// globalSetup runs in vitest's main thread, BEFORE any worker fork is
// created. Empirically (see `mu-test fork` probe in setup.ts), the env
// vitest mutates inside setup() IS visible to forks — so `setup()`
// is a working seam. BUT the contract is fragile: `process.env`
// mutation in async hooks can race with worker spawn on some
// vitest pool variants. To eliminate the risk entirely (round-3 fix
// for bug_test_flake_round_3 — Part A), we set `MU_TMUX_SOCKET` at
// MODULE LOAD time, before vitest has a chance to do anything else.
// Module load happens before setup() and unambiguously before any
// fork pool spins up. The setup() hook then bootstraps the actual
// tmux server (and reverts the env on bootstrap failure for
// graceful fallback).
//
// The realExecutor in src/tmux.ts reads `MU_TMUX_SOCKET` per-call (see
// `tmuxSocketArgs`) and prepends `-L <socket>` to every tmux invocation
// when set. Production code never sets the var; this file is the only
// caller.

// MU_TMUX_SOCKET on its allowlist, so forks inherit this value as-is.
// If the actual tmux server bootstrap inside setup() FAILS, we
// `delete process.env.MU_TMUX_SOCKET` there to fall back gracefully
// (otherwise forks would route through `-L <socket>` to a non-existent
// server and every tmux call would error).

  // on the same env-read path the realExecutor uses).
  //
  // `-f /dev/null` SKIPS the user's ~/.tmux.conf. This matters: a
  // typical config uses `run-shell` for status-bar plugins (TPM,
  // network probes, hostname pills, etc.), each of which adds
  // ~1–4s to the FIRST `new-session` after server startup. On the
  // dev box that motivated this task, a single integration test
  // ballooned 3s→48s before `-f /dev/null` was added. The user's
  // config has zero relevance to test correctness — the suite drives
  // tmux through the documented protocol, not through bound keys.
  //
  // `set -s exit-empty off` in the SAME invocation is what keeps this
  // server alive for the whole run, and it fixes a real flake
  // (flake-tmux-server-exited). tmux's server-level `exit-empty` option
  // defaults to ON: the server exits as soon as its last session is
  // killed. Integration tests kill their session in afterEach, so at
  // every test boundary the server is shutting down while the next
  // test's `new-session` connects to the socket — the client attaches
  // to a doomed server and gets `server exited unexpectedly` (exit 1).
  // Measured: 17/200 raw-tmux new-sessions, and
  // test/tmux.integration.test.ts failed 5/10 runs.
  //
  // With `exit-empty` off the server survives zero sessions, so the
  // race window never opens. It MUST be spliced into the same command
  // list as `start-server` (`;` is tmux's command separator): as a
  // SECOND execa call it is useless, because the freshly-started empty
  // server has already exited by then — that variant still failed
  // 23/200 in a raw-tmux probe; the atomic one, 0/200.
  //
  // Cost: if teardown() never runs (SIGKILLed runner) an idle empty

// ─── Layer 2 (round-4): DB-rooted default-socket sweep ────────────

/**
 * Round-4 replaced round-3's two-source allowlist (pre-existing
 * snapshot + DB) with a DB-only allowlist. The pre-existing snapshot
 * was a self-locking trap: leftover test residue on the user's
 * default socket at module-load time was "grandfathered in" as
 * protected forever, defeating the self-healing intent of the sweep
 * (see bug_test_flake_round_4_self_heal). The orchestrator had to
 * manually `tmux kill-session` 7 leaked sessions because each new
 * test run snapshotted them as preexisting and protected them.
 *
 * The allowlist approach inverts the question: instead of "does this
 * name look like test fixture residue?" we ask "is this name something
 * we KNOW we must protect?" Anything else is killed.
 *
 * The allowlist has two sources, unioned:
 *
 *   1. USER WORKSTREAMS — every workstream name in the user's REAL
 *      mu DB (every candidate from userDbPaths(): `MU_DB_PATH`,
 *      `MU_STATE_DIR/mu.db`, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mu/mu.db`).
 *      A `mu-<name>` session matching one of these is the user's
 *      workstream session, even if it was created mid-suite by an
 *      orchestrator agent. We can't open the DB through the SDK
 *      `openDb()` because round-2 added a hard guard that REFUSES to
 *      open the user DB during vitest — so we open via better-sqlite3
 *      directly with `{ readonly: true }`. Reading is metadata-only;
 *      the readonly flag enforces "no writes possible" at the SQLite
 *      layer (and the round-2 guard's intent was to prevent test
 *      WRITES, not metadata reads).
 *
 *   2. THE ORCHESTRATOR'S OWN SESSION — `mu-$MU_SESSION` if
 *      `$MU_SESSION` is set in the parent shell. Belt-and-suspenders
 *      protection for the workstream the orchestrator is actively
 *      running in, in case its row is in a DB we did not read.
 *
 * If no candidate DB exists, or one exists but cannot be read, there
 * is no allowlist and the sweep is skipped (fail OPEN).
 *
 * Anything on the default socket starting with `mu-` and NOT in the
 * union of those two sets is, by elimination, test residue — a
 * session our suite created by accidentally bypassing the private
 * `-L <socket>` (legacy hardcoded-name tests, future tests that spawn
 * `execa("tmux", …)` directly without routing through src/tmux.ts,
 * etc). We kill it.
 *
 * Cost: an ad-hoc `tmux new-session -t mu-foo` with no DB row gets
 * killed by the sweep. Workaround: `mu workstream init foo` first
 * (which the user would need to do anyway to use it as a workstream).
 */

/**
 * Every path the user's REAL DB can live at, resolved the way
 * src/db.ts `defaultDbPath()` does: `MU_DB_PATH`, else
 * `MU_STATE_DIR/mu.db`, else `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mu/mu.db`. globalSetup
 * runs in vitest's main process with the developer's unscrubbed env
 * (test/_setup.ts only scrubs forks), so these are the user's values.
 * We read EVERY candidate, not just the winner: the user's sessions
 * may belong to a DB the current shell does not point at, and a
 * larger allowlist only means fewer kills. We open via better-sqlite3
 * directly because `openDb()` refuses the user DB under vitest.
